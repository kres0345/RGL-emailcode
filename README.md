# RGL-Emailcode
RGL-emailcode is a program I created to simplify and make the process of retrieving the one time key from email, in renegadeline.com faster.

You can download the program here: [https://github.com/kres0345/RGL-emailcode/releases](https://github.com/kres0345/RGL-emailcode/releases)

### Limitations: 
- Your account has to be signed up with a Gmail account.
- The email containing the code has to be the last email you received(I don't want to look through your whole inbox)
- You need to have [allow less-secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) disabled on the Gmail you're using (This is not possible without it disabled)

### This version works like this:
- You insert your Gmail account name e.g. `example321` (not: `example321@gmail.com`)
- You type your password (When typing it won't show publicly).

### Things this program doesn't do:
- Store your emails in any way (I don't have enough storage ;-), (unlike Google).
- Save your Email address or password.
- If not convinced, feel free to scan with anti-virus (If it detects it as a virus then say it in issues, because that would be weird)(No seriously).

If you still think this is malware feel free to check the comments in [rglemail.py](https://github.com/kres0345/RGL-emailcode/blob/master/Commented%20rglemail.txt) (it's the main file)
the comments explain what the different functions does. You can also just ask me in the issues section.
